            <p>"Clayton the oldest pain in my ass, he graduated from Nowhere University and is currently living with his baby momma. They are hoping the trailor will be big enough for everyone!! Clayton works seldom and is currently unable to count past 9 due to the fact he lost his pinky finger in last years "4th of July" incident."</font></p>

        <h2 class="subheader">Carter</h2>
        <p>"Carter, hasn't seen the light of day for at least 2 years since the release of Fortnite! His mother is still convinced this is just a phase, but I don't see any reason to be hopeful that he is going to ever move out of my basement. At least I dont have to worry about grandkids with this one."</p>

            <p>"Carson, he loves to entertain and is going to make it big time! That is why he moved to Hollywood to become the next action star. Sadly he hasn't done anything other than, wonder up and down Hollywood Blvd, hoping to con some poor parents out of a couple bucks because he took a picture with their kids!"</p>
